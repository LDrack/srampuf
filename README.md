# stm32-srampuf
 STM32 SRAM PUF project built with PlatformIO.
 
 I developed this tool in the course of my master thesis at FH Hagenberg. It is a very simple and experimental implementation of an SRAM PUF. I deployed it on Nucleo F401RE and F446RE development boards, resulting in the desired SRAM PUF behaviour. Again, this code is simple - I did not modify the bootloader, instead I read the SRAM PUF in main(), sending the SRAM's fingerprint over UART to my C# backend.
